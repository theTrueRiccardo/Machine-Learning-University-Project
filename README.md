# Machine-Learning-University-Project
This is the project done for the Machine Learning course at University of Calabria. 
The repository is not frozen and gets updated every now and then, when I have free time
and when I think that something can be done better.

The project involves two tasks:
1. Classification
2. Semi-supervised anomaly detection

Both tasks are done with two datasets:
1. A dataset of flowers - images
2. A dataset of articles - text

Moreover, the classification task must be done by using all and only the following models:
1. AdaBoost
2. SVM
3. Neural networks
4. Density estimation (e.g. KNN)

while the semi-supervised anomaly detection task can be solved by using just one of the models
used with classification.
